Recursive algorithm oscillator for max msp. The first thing I coded for Max, to learn the API. The first thing I coded in C that wasn't just a learning exercise

First github project and 2nd C coding project

An attempt to write framework for sonifying recursive algorithms in MAX MSP. 
The aim is just to get a code structure into which I can plug various recursive algorithms.

v1. features wishlist:
Variable iteration rate rate 
Choice of interpolation algorithms
Port to 64bit max

v2. wishlist:
Can I think of a way to handle matsuoka oscillator at variable iteration rate? 
There input signal is quite decisive, making calculation of next value (which is integral to my version) difficult
